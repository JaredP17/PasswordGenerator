## Description 
An application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It also features a clean and polished user interface and is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Check out the deployable site here: [Password Generator](https://jaredp17.github.io/PasswordGenerator/).

## Usage
1. Clone the repo or open deployable site.
    * Open index.html in default browser (if cloned).
